This project shows a simple example of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being used together to create a clean resume-like page.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**  
    I use both tag and id selectors, as well as a CSS variable. `linear-gradient` is used to make the highlight over my name slightly thinner. `margin` and `display: inline-block` are used to make things look prettier, and `min()` is used to make the page cleanly support a variety of aspect ratios nicely.
- **Name shuffles through fonts**  
    Every 300ms, my name will randomly switch to a new font (of three total).

### Design Achievements
- **Used various fonts from Google Fonts**  
    Roboto is used as the primary font and Cedarville Cursive and Abril Fatface are used as secondary fonts for when my name shuffles through fonts.
- **Emoji used for displaying skill level**  
    Rather than just using text, the face on an emoji is used to show my proficiency at a particular skill. This seems to be a popular kind of design decision among "hip" sites nowadays.
- **Padding to make the site more breathable**  
    Padding on the top, left, and right makes the site nicer to read.
